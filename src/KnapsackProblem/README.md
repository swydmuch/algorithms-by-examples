# Task Prioritization in Software Development Using the Knapsack Problem

In software development, teams often need to prioritize tasks to be completed within limited resources, such as time, budget, or workforce. The **knapsack problem** provides a structured approach to make these decisions by optimizing the selection of tasks to maximize business value while staying within constraints.

## Problem Definition

1. **Tasks (Items):** Each task has a defined **business value** (e.g., impact on user satisfaction, revenue, or system stability) and a **cost** in terms of story points.
2. **Team velocity (Knapsack Capacity):** The total number of story points the team can handle during a sprint.
3. **Goal:** Select a subset of tasks that maximizes the overall business value while ensuring the total cost (story points) does not exceed the capacity (team velocity).


### Algorithm (Using Dynamic Programming)

The algorithm evaluates all possible combinations of tasks to find the optimal solution:

1. Initialize a two-dimensional table with zeros, where the first dimension has one more element than the number of tasks, and the second dimension has one more element than the team's velocity.
2. Fill the table with the best values for each possible velocity (less than or equal to the team velocity) 
    - Consider one task at time and increase considered velocity from 0 to team velocity.
    - If the considered task is less than or equal to the considered velocity, calculate whether it is better to include it or not. 
    - In case the considered task is bigger than considered velocity, just use the previously calculated value at the considered velocity
3. The best value is located in the bottom-right cell of the table (at index [number of tasks][team velocity])."

### How to calculate value for considered velocity?
If the considered task is less than or equal to the considered velocity, we calculate value for two variants:
1. Include task
    - To find this value we use considered task value. In addition, we must reduce considered velocity with the considered task value    
2. Exclude task
    - We take previously calculated value for considered velocity 


### Which tasks gives Us best value?
Find the most valuable tasks by traversing the table elements in the following way

1. Start with bottom-right cell
2. If cell above has same value, it means task from this row is not included, and we go to the cell above
3. If cell above has different value, it means task from this row is included, and we move to the row above and move to the left as many times as task story points is.
4. Continue until value 0 is found

## Benefits

1. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Ensures tasks with the highest impact are prioritized.
2. **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Prevents over-commitment and ensures maximum value within constraints.
3. **Scalability:** Can be adapted to future sprints or changing resource constraints.

By applying the knapsack problem to task prioritization, software teams can make informed, transparent, and optimal decisions about sprint planning.
